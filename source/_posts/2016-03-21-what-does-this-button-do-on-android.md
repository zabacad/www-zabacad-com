## Or: The mystery Google Hangouts button

I was talking with a friend using
[Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) when he wanted to show me
something in his house, so we got on a Google Hangout. Just for fun, I joined
the hangout from both my computer and phone.

We get distracted and spent about 15 minutes try to determine what this button
does:

![Mystery button]({{site.url}}/images/posts/what-does-this-button-do-on-android/hangouts_speaker.png)

It would toggle between that and this, and sometimes turn video off:

![Mystery button]({{site.url}}/images/posts/what-does-this-button-do-on-android/hangouts_handset.png)

Searching for "Android Hangouts phone wavy lines icon", of course, turned up
nothing. A reverse image search suggested The Prince of Jordan, but nothing
useful. Android's interface is supposed to be self-explanatory, so there is no
documentation.

Eventually, he figured it out: **Long-pressing gives a tooltip.** In our case,
the mystery buttons are "speakerphone" and "handset". That probably would have
been more obvious if we had been using Hangouts for audio.
